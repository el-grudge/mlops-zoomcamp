In week 3️⃣ of the MLOps Zoomcamp we learned about

💇‍♀️ Orchestration and ML Pipelines with Mage  

Mage is an open source data orchestration tool. It provides a notebook-like interface that makes it easy to build, run, and debug ML pipelines.

New features  

In previous versions it was hard to create multiple projects in Mage, something that has been addressed in v0.9.71. Simply open the text editor from the command center and right click on the parent folder and select New Mage Project.

When building a pipeline, it is useful to create visualizations of your data to inspect its different features, and look for skewness in any of their its distribution. Mage makes it easy to create charts of your data by clicking on the chart icon on the right corner of your block. All standard chart types are available.
